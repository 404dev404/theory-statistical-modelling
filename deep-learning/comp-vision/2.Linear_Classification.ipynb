Depending on precisely what values we set for these weights, the function has the capacity to like or dislike certain colors at certain positions in the image. For instance you can image the \"ship\" class might be more likely if there is a lot of blue on the sides of an image (corresponding to water). You might want expect that the 'ship' classifier would then have a lot of positive weights across it's blue channel weights, and negative weights in the red/gree channels."

The score of each class for an image is then obtained by comparing each template with the image using an _inner product_ one by one to find the one that \"fits\" best. With this terminology, the linear classifier is doing template matching, where the templates are learned. Another way to think of that is that we are still effectively doing Nearest Neigbor, but instead of having thousands of training images we are only using a single image per class (although we will learn it, and it does not necessarily have to be one of the images in the training set,) and we can use the inner product as the distance instead of L1 or L2 distance"

    "Additionally, note that the horse template seems to contain a two-headed horse, which is due to both left and right facing horses in the dataset. The linear classifier **merges** these two modes of horses in the data into a single template. Similarly, the car classifier seems to have merged several modes into a single template which has to identify cars from alls ides, and of all colors. In particular, this template ended up being red, which hints that there are more red cards in the CIFAR-10 dataset than of any other color. The linear classifier is too weak to properly account for different-colored cards, but as we will see later neural networks will allow us to perform this task. Looking ahead a bit, a neural network will be able to develop intermediate neurons in its hidden layers that could detect specific car types (e.g. green car facing left, blue car facing fron, etc) and neurons on the next layer could combine these into a more accurate car score through a weighted sum of the individual car detectors."

In Machine Learning, it is very common practice to always perform normalization on your input features (in the case of images, every pixel is through of as a feature). In particular, it is important to **center your data** by subtracting the mean from every feature. In the case of images, this corresponds to computing a *mean image* across the training images and subtracting it from every image to get images where the pixels range from approximately [-127... 127]. Further common preprocessing is to scale each input feature so that its values range from [-1,1]. Of these, zero mean centering is arguably more important but we will have to wait for its justification until we understand the dunamics of gradient descent."

In fact the difference was 20, which is much greater than 10 but the SVM only cares that the difference is at least 10; Any additional difference above the margin is clamped at zero with the max operation. The second term computes [11 - 13 + 10] which gives 8. That is, even though the correct class had a higher score than the incorrect class (13 > 11), it was not greater than the desired margin of 10.

The issues is that this set of *W* is not necessarily unqiue: there might be many similar *W* that correctly classify the examples. One easy way to see this is that if some parameters *W* correctly classify all examples (so loss is zero for each example), then any multiple of these parameteres $\\lambda W $ where $\\lambda > 1$ will also give zero loss because this transformation uniformly stretches all scores magnitudes and hence also their abosulute differences.
